### Scoring System

Each item will be scored using the following categories with clickable dots:

- ● Absent = 0 points
- ● Emerging = 1 point
- ● Present = 2 points

Each item will be associated with a radio button group that lets the user select one of these three options. Scores will be totaled:

- Per item
- Per age band
- Overall total

A written summary report will be auto-generated, incorporating:
- Item-level scores
- Age-band performance highlights
- Flags for any "absent" items significantly below expected age
- Clinical impressions
- Recommendations

Users will have the ability to **download results as a PDF or Word document**.

Next step: generate the Streamlit Python code to match this structure with interactive UI and report generation.
